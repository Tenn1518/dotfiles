** Prerequisites

Install emacs, zsh, tmux, a terminal emulator with true color support, a nice theme (dracula) for your terminal, and the Iosevka family of fonts.

** How to Install

Install the dotfiles with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Tenn1518/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will symlink folders and files from their respective locations in $HOME to under ~/.dotfiles

Upon entering emacs, run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~.

| emacs   | Personal favorite text editor/OS that can do whatever I need to do during development. Representing everything in text and manipulating it with Lisp functions is a great idea, and all of the benefits of vim are included with evil-mode. |
| Sway    | I usually use GNOME, but there is no way to bootstrap my GNOME configuration from .dotfiles, so I've started working on exwm and Sway configs for use on other computers                                                                    |
| neovim  | Legacy configuration from before I started using emacs. I don't even need it for quick edits because I've aliased ~em~ to ~emacsclient -t~ to quickly connect to the emacs daemon. But there's no reason to get rid of it.                      |
