Configuration files for programs such as emacs, zsh, etc to bootstrap onto a
UNIX-like operating system.

This project is licensed under the terms of the [[https://github.com/Tenn1518/dotfiles/blob/master/LICENSE][MIT license]].

** Prerequisites

Linux: ~Light~ (tool to change backlight)

macOS: ~Homebrew~

*: ~emacs~, ~zsh~, ~alacritty~, and the Iosevka family of fonts

** How to Install

Install the dotfiles with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Tenn1518/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will symlink folders and files from their respective locations in $HOME to
under ~/.dotfiles

/My Emacs config doesn't use all-the-icons anymore, so this will not
work. Install all-the-icons from the submodule instead./ Upon entering emacs,
run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~. This will install icon fonts not only for
emacs, but also for ~waybar~.
